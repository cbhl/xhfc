<h2>Jamie's Drawing Telephone Game Thing</h2>

Rules:
1) Start with a tall strip of paper for each person. 
2) Write a noun at the top of the page. Fold over to hide the noun and pass to your left. 
3) write the rest of a sentence and pass to your left. 
4) unfold the top to reveal both rows. Draw a picture of the sentence. Fold over top so only your picture is visible. Pass to your left. 
5) write a sentence that describes the picture. Fold over top to hide the picture. Pass to your left. 
6) draw a picture of the sentence. Fold. Pass. 
7) repeat 5 & 6 until you get to the end of the page

<h2>Things In A Box</h2>

Rules:
1) Everyone gets post-its and pens.
2) Pick a moderator. Moderator rotates clockwise with each round. Moderator picks a topic and announces it aloud, for example, "square things".
3) Everyone except the moderator writes down a thing in that category. Moderator SHOULD NOT clarify what the category means. Pass the paper, to the moderator, without letting anyone see what you wrote.
4) Moderator reads each item aloud, once.
5) Each person not eliminated, starting from the left of the moderator, guesses an item read out loud and a person who wrote it.
6) The person accused says "yes" (if they wrote it) or "no". Be honest.
7) If the accused says "yes", then the accused 'dies' for that round, and the guessor gains one point and another turn. If no other people remain, the guessor gains a second point for being the last person standing.
8) If the accused says "no", the next 'alive' person clockwise is now the guessor.
9) The winner is the person who has the most points once everyone has been moderator for one round.
10) Drinking variant: Everyone takes a shot if "your mom" is NOT on exactly one piece of paper in each round.

<h2>No Talking</h2>

Rules:
1) I am the moderator. For the duration of the game, nobody can talk unless I say so.
2) Everyone stand in a circle. Count off starting from one. (One.) ... Everybody remember your number.
3) Everybody switch places with someone randomly.
4) Now I am going to step out of the circle to create a gap.
5) The person to the left of the gap is the only person who can talk. They can only say two things: "count" or a number.
6) If they say count, the person to their left says their number. If the number is one, then the person to their left says their number. If that number is two, then, the person to their left says their number, and so on.
7) If they say a number, the person with that number moves to the gap, to create a new gap.
8) The game ends if you count up to <number of other people minus the moderator>.
